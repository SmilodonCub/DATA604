    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color is a phenomenologically prominent feature of our visual experience of the world. However, the neural representation of color as uniques hues remains poorly understood. While precortical representations of luminance and chromatic contrast have be well characterized and considerable efforts have been made to understand how these signals combine in early stages of the coritcal visual hierarchy, comparatively fewer studies have been made of higher order"
