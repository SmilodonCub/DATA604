    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color is a phenomenologically prominent feature of our visual experience of the world. However, the neural representation of color as uniques hues remains poorly understood. While precortical representations of luminance and chromatic contrast have be well characterized and considerable efforts have been made to understand how these signals combine in the earliest stage of the cortical visual hierarchy (V1), comparatively fewer studies have been made of higher order representations of color. Recently, Mehrani *et al* (1) presented a hierarchical model inspired by known neuronal mechanisms of unique hue representations. Successive stages of the model incorporate experimentally derived weights and computational appraches to model the visual signal processing stages of color signals withn the primate visual pathways. This simulation study will replicate the hierarchical model of hue representation and discuss possible future directions and applications."

    "## Introduction & Relevant Background\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To model the neural representation of color and hue in cortex of human observers, this simulation approximates visual signals from the earliest stages of reception across the retina through to higher visual cortical areas such as Inferotemporal (IT) cortex. The model takes a hierarchical approach with each layer corresponding to a physiological area in the primate visual pathway. Temporal latencies, Receptive field sizes and computational approaches are based on experimental results from a number of different studies. To rationalize this approach, a brief introduction to primate visual pathways is necessary. Visual signals originate in the retina and most retinal output projects to a midbrain structure in the thalamus, the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). From the LGN, visual signals primarily project to the primary visual cortex (V1) as the first stage of cortical visual signal processing. Signals incoming to V1 from precortical projections are relatively simple signals of luminance or chromatic contrast. However, each successive cortical visual area performs a unique computation(s) on the incoming signal and the output builds in complexity as signals propagate to higher order visual cortical areas. From V1, two major visual pathway emerge that carry different aspects of the visual signal in parallel: (1) the dorsal pathway also referred to as the 'where' pathway, which leads to areas in the Parietal Cortex. (2) the ventral pathway, also known as the 'what' pathway which leads to areas in the Inferotemporal Cortex.\n",
