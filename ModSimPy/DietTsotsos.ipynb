    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color is a phenomenologically prominent feature of our visual experience of the world. However, the neural representation of color as uniques hues remains poorly understood. While precortical representations of luminance and chromatic contrast have been well characterized and considerable efforts have been made to understand how these signals combine in the earliest stage of the cortical visual hierarchy (V1), comparatively fewer studies have been made of higher order representations of color. Recently, Mehrani *et al* (1) presented a hierarchical model inspired by known neuronal mechanisms of unique hue representations. Successive stages of the model incorporate experimentally derived weights and computational appraches to model the visual signal processing stages of color signals withn the primate visual pathways. This simulation study will replicate the hierarchical model of hue representation and discuss possible future directions and applications."

    "## Introduction & Relevant Background\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To model the neural representation of color and hue in cortex of human observers, this simulation approximates visual signals from the earliest stages of reception across the retina through to higher visual cortical areas such as Inferotemporal (IT) cortex. The model takes a hierarchical approach with each layer corresponding to a physiological area in the primate visual pathway. Temporal latencies, Receptive field sizes and computational approaches are based on experimental findings from a number of different studies. The goal of this simulation is to simulate a possible coding strategy for efficient representation of hue in the later stages of visual signal processing that occur in IT cotex.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rationalize this approach, a brief introduction to primate visual pathways is necessary. Visual signals originate in the retina and most retinal output projects to a midbrain structure in the thalamus, the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). From the LGN, visual signals primarily project to the primary visual cortex (V1) as the first stage of cortical visual signal processing. Signals incoming to V1 from precortical projections are relatively simple signals of luminance or chromatic contrast. However, each successive cortical visual area performs a unique computation(s) on the incoming signal and the output builds in complexity as signals propagate to higher order visual cortical areas. From V1, two major visual pathway diverge and carry different aspects of the visual signal in parallel: (1) the dorsal pathway also referred to as the 'where' pathway, which leads to areas in the Parietal Cortex. (2) the ventral pathway, also known as the 'what' pathway which leads to areas in the Inferotemporal Cortex.\n",

    "### Precortical Visual Pathways\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of visual signals begins with signal transduction by specialized sensory receptor cells in the retina, the rods and cones. The retina is a laminar structure, with the receptors in the most distal layer of cells. For vision in photopic conditions (high light levels e.g. daylight or indoor lighting), the rod photoreceptors are largely inactive due to saturation and the bullwork of conscious vision is handled by the cone photoreceptors. This simulation assumes photopic conditions. Old world primates (humans included!) generally have trichromatic vision owing to the presense of three distinct classes of cone photoreceptors (Long, Medium, Short or L,M,S cones). The sensitivity of cones can be described roughly as a bandpass filter with each class having a sensitivy peak at a different wavelength of light (L:564nm, M:534nm & S:420nm) (Fig 2 from ref. 3). The first step of this simulation is to transform RGB stimulus values to LMS cone activation signals (4).   \n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cone photoreceptors output a graded response to changes in incident light which is passed vertically to the bipolar cell layer and on to the Retinal Ganglion Cell (RGC) layer. Different combinations of LMS cone signals are shaped in each successive layer to build in response complexity and specificity. The graded cone response signalling relative sensitivity to a change in incident light is transformed to a non-linear spike in activity in response to a change in luminance or chromatic contrast for which a class of RGC is specifically wired for. RGC inherit signals that subtend the region of the visual field that it's connected receptors are selective for, this is referred to as the RGC's receptive field (RF). For example, an On-center Parvocellular RGC recieves input from one or few L or M cone photoreceptors to the center of it's RF center while the RF surround may revieve inputs from a wider sampling of the cones. The output of the cell is shaped by the difference between the RGC's RF center and surround mechanisms. The antagonistic center/surround motif is a staple of RF structures in precortical visual neurons (5) and is commonly modelled as a Difference of Gaussians (6) (Fig 3).\n",
