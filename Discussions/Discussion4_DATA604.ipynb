    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the study from this week's reading(1) is to optimize the RainWater Harvesting (RWH) system requirements for a given system design to assess whether it meets the water needs of a Central Texas residence with 100% demand satisfaction. This study references the non-parametric, stochastic model developed by Basinger *et al* (2). Basinger *et al* developed a Storage and Reliability Estimation Tool (SARET) which estimates the reliability that a RWH system can meet water usage needs for a given region provided known precipitation patterns. The Basinger study is quite interesting (and relevant to CUNY SPS students) because it presents a case study based on urban NYC multifamily residential buildings. Fulton *et al* extend SARET from 25 to 64 years of historical rainfall data and apply the model to a RWH build in the Central Texas region.   \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARET uses a series of probability equations (equations 3-8 in ref(1)) to generate a precipitation ensemble, or a series of rainfall simultions which are then sampled by bootstrapping methods to estimate the reliability that a given system can meet a user's needs given the system at criterion. For the Fulton study, the criterin was quite strict: **100% satisfaction** (100% zombie apacalypse preparedness). The output from the SARET derived rainfall predictions were passed through simple estimations for system efficiency/capture rates. From there, balance equations were used to estimate overflow, shortages, and volume in the cistern. The balance equation estimates were then evaluated for whether the simulation guranteed 100% demand satisfaction. This criterion was used to optimize the water capture cistern size. For example, the simulation was not successful with a 3000ft^2 roof capture space. However, as roof area increased, the cistern size demand decreased (a cistern of any size should work with a roof size of 5000ft^2.  \n",
